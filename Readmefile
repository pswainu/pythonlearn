 """
      Create a deny policy.
      You can add deny policies to organizations, folders, and projects.
      Each of these resources can have up to 5 deny policies.

      Deny policies contain deny rules, which specify the following:
      1. The permissions to deny and/or exempt.
      2. The principals that are denied, or exempted from denial.
      3. An optional condition on when to enforce the deny rules.

      Params:
      project_id: ID or number of the Google Cloud project you want to use.
      policy_id: Specify the ID of the deny policy you want to create.
    """

    
    # Each deny policy is attached to an organization, folder, or project.
    # To work with deny policies, specify the attachment point.
    #
    # Its format can be one of the following:
    # 1. cloudresourcemanager.googleapis.com/organizations/ORG_ID
    # 2. cloudresourcemanager.googleapis.com/folders/FOLDER_ID
    # 3. cloudresourcemanager.googleapis.com/projects/PROJECT_ID
    #
    # The attachment point is identified by its URL-encoded resource name. Hence, replace
    # the "/" with "%2F".
    # Add one or more principals who should be denied the permissions specified in this rule.
    # For more information on allowed values, see: https://cloud.google.com/iam/help/deny/principal-identifiers
    # Optionally, set the principals who should be exempted from the
    # list of denied principals. For example, if you want to deny certain permissions
    # to a group but exempt a few principals, then add those here.
    # deny_rule.exception_principals = ["principalSet://goog/group/project-admins@example.com"]

    # Set the permissions to deny.
    # The permission value is of the format: service_fqdn/resource.action
    # For the list of supported permissions, see: https://cloud.google.com/iam/help/deny/supported-permissions

    # Optionally, add the permissions to be exempted from this rule.
    # Meaning, the deny rule will not be applicable to these permissions.
    # deny_rule.exception_permissions = ["cloudresourcemanager.googleapis.com/projects.create"]

    # Set the condition which will enforce the deny rule.
    # If this condition is true, the deny rule will be applicable. Else, the rule will not be enforced.
    # The expression uses Common Expression Language syntax (CEL).
    # Here we block access based on tags.
    #
    # Here, we create a deny rule that denies the cloudresourcemanager.googleapis.com/projects.delete permission to everyone except project-admins@example.com for resources that are tagged test.
    # A tag is a key-value pair that can be attached to an organization, folder, or project.
